## OpenCASCADE

  https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT

  Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) a software
development platform providing services for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD 
data exchange, and visualization. Most of OCCT functionality is available in 
the form of C++ libraries. OCCT can be best applied in development of software 
dealing with 3D modeling (CAD), manufacturing / measuring (CAM) or numerical 
simulation (CAE).
  
## IMGUI
  https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

  Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).

Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries.

Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in game engines (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on console platforms where operating system features are non-standard.

## GLFW
  https://github.com/glfw/glfw

  GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

GLFW natively supports Windows, macOS and Linux and other Unix-like systems. On Linux both X11 and Wayland are supported.

GLFW is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.

## Build
Use Premake5 to build OcctImgui.
